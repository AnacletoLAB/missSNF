Description: Implementation of miss-SNF, a modification of the algorithm Similarity Network
    Fusion (https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2810) to handle the absence
    (complete or nearly complete) of a specific data modality.
    In particular, two strategies to implement missSNF are considered:
    \itemize{
    \item "reconstruct" can partially reconstruct missing
    data by using information from different sources
    \item "ignore" which simply ignores missing data during the integration 
    process.
